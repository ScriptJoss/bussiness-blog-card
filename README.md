## What I learned

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges, especially finding the perfect height for the elements. However, I managed to overcome these obstacles and learn a lot in the process. I used ChatGPT not only to get answers, but as a resource to better understand how the `position` property works in CSS. I learned how to use `position` effectively, which allowed me to improve the design and functionality of the business card.

## Acknowledgements

I really enjoyed the challenge and am pleased with the final result. This project has helped me consolidate my CSS skills and apply responsive design concepts.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

A responsive business card, with an image, descriptive text and a small image with the business owner
